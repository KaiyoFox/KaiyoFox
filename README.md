# Hi there, I'm Kaiyo! 👋

I'm Kaiyo, known as Bluefox on the internet. While Cyber Security isn't my cup of tea, Software Development is where I thrive, and I'm always tinkering with server setups and exploring the world of coding. When I'm not glued to my keyboard, you'll likely find me soldering circuits or diving into the intricate details of server administration.
